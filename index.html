            Hello, welcome to Matthew Kind's Projects Page
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is the general home page for many of the projects I've worked on in the past, as well as ones I'm currently working on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are brief descriptions of each of the projects as well as links to pages with more details.
        </p>

            Note that some projects are based on school work, meaning I can't show them in their entirety.

                    This is my current project where I'm combining MatPlotLib and libROSA to create a typical audio
                    visualizer across two axes, plus a third axis for time.
