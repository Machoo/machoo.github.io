                Project Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a school project making use of data science and numerical computation techniques to analyze
                Pokemon data collected from online.
                Some of this code was developed with a partner, but all of the code and analysis shown here is my
                own.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin with some background, Pokemon is a video game series that involves turn-based battling,
                Pokemon catching, and exploration.
                My focus is solely on the battling aspect, and moreso the competitive side. At this level of
                battling, Pokemon teams can be extensively customized, begging the question of:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What variables in team composition can be the most influential in a team's success?</strong>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" aria-label="Data Collection">
            <h2>
                Data Collection
            </h2>
            <p>
                To answer this question, I made use of the de-facto hub for competitive Pokemon battling: Pokemon
                Showdown.
                This is an unofficial, free, online Pokemon battle simulator that provides numerous different
                formats for players to battle against each other.
                Showdown offers an API to access all of the recent records it has stored, which provided more than
                enough data to work with.
                This API interaction and initial data collection was handled by my partner, before they handed the
                raw data over to me.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" aria-label="Data Cleaning">
            <h2>
                Data Cleaning
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first step in cleaning these data was to extract the data for each team that was brought to each
                battle.
                The raw data collected from Showdown contained much more information than we needed for our
                analysis, so this step largely removed the unnecessary data.
                The reduced data that we stored listed the six Pokemon present on each team as well as whether that
                team won the battle that it was used in or not.
                However, some teams were excluded from this congregation on account of them not having a full roster
                of six Pokemon.
                We regarded these teams to not be worth considering due to them either being unserious or intended
                for testing, both of which would muddy the data.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" aria-label="Data Representation & Analysis">
            <h2>
                Data Representation & Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>
                The second step was to use these gathered teams to create a local lookup table for all of the
                Pokemon present in all of the teams.
                This table would allow me to easily convert the Pokemon's name, which is what Showdown provided,
                into the Pokemon's stats, which are the only values relevant to us.
                To accomplish this I made use of PokeAPI, which enabled me to retrieve Pokemon stats using names.
                In order to use this API however, I needed to convert the names provided by Showdown into ones that
                would be recognized by PokeAPI.
                This process involved a large amount of manual conversions due to the varied nature of Pokemon
                naming conventions and alternate forms that players are able to choose from.
                With the name corrections completed, it was a simple process to download the relevant stats and
                attach them to the Showdown names in a dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the lookup table complete, our stored teams could have each Pokemon turned into its constituent
                stats.
                We decided to represent each team as the centroid of the Pokemon's stats, which would put it into a
                six-dimensional space, plus a boolean for win-or-lose.
                With the list of centroids complete, my part of the coding for this project was also complete.
                From here I worked with my partner on the analysis of the data, where they brought their expertise
                to incorporate the wins and losses of teams into our models.
                We found that the competitive scene that we viewed in Pokemon Showdown was fairly healthy, and
                encouraged creativity and skillful playing from users.
                However, I would go on to use the data collected and refined here in another project, relating to
                numerical computation.
                Through this, I gained experience in the data cleaning and analysis sides of the same dataset.
