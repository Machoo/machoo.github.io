            <p>
                The Regional Climate Factor Analysis project will focus on how numerous factors within different regions, largely separated by country, influence climate change in those regions.
                Climate change is more than just global warming; chemical changes, such as an increase in carbon dioxide, can also be important to observe.
                Climate change is also a global problem; however, local effects of climate change are variable, and many problems that contribute to climate change will also contribute to local atmospheric phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
                This analysis will be completed through the use of numerous data science methods applied to datasets collected from reputable sources, including NASA, the IPCC, and Open-Meteo.
                These datasets contain information about many ecological variables, some extra details about each country, climate model predictions, and climate observations.
                Through the combined usage of these datasets, analysis into the impacts of these ecological variables as well as the predictions of climate models can proceed.

            <p>
                The inspiration for this project began with questions about climate models.
                Many climate models exist, and are maintained by different organizations.
                These models are frequently combined into an ensemble, with the hope of improving accuracy in general.
                However, models are frequently tuned to best explain and predict phenomena local to the developers of the model.
                While this provides variety in an ensemble model to cover any weaknesses, this also means that some models will be better able to represent circumstances for certain areas.
                The results of these independent climate models can be important to policy makers from the region.
                Being better informed about the severity of climate change, including the factors that contribute to it as well as how it contributes to the local environment, can be critical to how eco-friendly initiatives are approached.

            <p>
                This introduction leads to a series of questions that further analysis will focus on:
            </p>
            <p>
                • How do pollutants and ecological determinants influence climatic conditions across locations worldwide today? <br>
                • How have these same factors influenced climatic conditions across regions throughout the past? <br>
                • How do these influences vary by location?
                Are there differences in severity based on factors such as latitude, distance to a coast, or prevailing winds? <br>
                • Do socio-economic factors of a country, such as its GDP, correlate to its emissions and general ecological impact?
                How strong are the correlations, or how impactful are their absences? <br>
                • How accurate are climate models, including ensembles, in predicting global conditions in recent years? <br>
                • How accurate are climate models in predicting conditions in regions that they are specialized for? <br>
                • How inaccurate are climate models in predicting conditions in regions with different conditions than the ones that they are specialized for?
                Are the insufficiencies outweighed by improved performance in the local region? <br>
                • Do climate models perform best in recent years?
                Do they fail to predict past conditions as well as they predict current conditions? <br>
                • Do various climate models fail to predict similar conditions?
                Are there groupings of models that can show underlying similarities, either in how they were constructed or in the circumstances that they are tuned for? <br>
                • How much do ensembles of climate models improve accuracy overall?
                How do ensemble models perform in areas that individual models are tuned for?
            </p>
