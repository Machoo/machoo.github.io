                Data science project analyzing competitive Pokemon team compositions using statistical methods and
                numerical computation.
                Focused on data pipeline development, API integration, and statistical
                preprocessing.
                This analysis represents the data collection and cleaning phase, with numerical computation detailed
                separately. [[You should probably just combine it all into one page]]

                Pokemon competitive battling involves turn-based strategy with extensive team customization options.
                The core research question addresses competitive meta health:

                <strong>Hypothesis: Competitive Pokemon meta diversity can be quantified through team composition
                    variance and win-rate analysis.</strong>

                Implemented Pokemon Showdown API integration for battle data extraction. Showdown hosts competitive
                battles with comprehensive match records accessible via [[RESTful API endpoints]]. Data extraction
                involved JSON
                parsing and HTTP request management for large-scale dataset compilation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applied domain-specific filtering to reduce data complexity and maintain project scope within time
                constraints.
                Focus limited to team composition analysis, excluding in-battle decision trees that would require
                sequential analysis of player actions. This constraint reduced data dimensionality while preserving
                strategic team-building insights.

                Implemented data validation by filtering incomplete team compositions. Teams with fewer than six Pokemon
                were excluded as they represented non-competitive matches or testing scenarios, ensuring dataset quality
                for meaningful statistical analysis. [[TODO: add "filtered out X% of initial dataset"]]

            <p>
                Developed data transformation pipeline converting Pokemon names to six-dimensional stat vectors.
                This approach enabled numerical analysis while maintaining team composition characteristics essential
                for competitive evaluation. Non-quantifiable attributes were excluded to maintain analytical
                consistency.

            <p>
                Implemented local caching system using PokeAPI for stat data retrieval. Created lookup table to
                eliminate
                redundant API calls for frequently-used Pokemon, significantly reducing data acquisition latency.
                [[TODO: add "reduced API calls by X% through caching optimization"]]
                Required custom name mapping between Pokemon Showdown and PokeAPI naming conventions due to format

                Final dataset comprised team records represented as six-dimensional vectors (HP, Attack, Defense,
                Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) computed as mean values across team members, paired with
                binary win/loss outcomes. This representation enabled statistical analysis of team composition
                effectiveness while maintaining computational efficiency.

                Collaborative analysis with team partner integrated win/loss metrics into comprehensive meta-health

            <p>
                On first inspection, the graphs are clearly messy, and many do not contain notable information.
                However, there are still plenty of interesting points to analyze. [[Then show it. If your results aren't visible, then it isn't a good visualization. Consider doing a custom visualization for each point you expand on below]]
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph of HP vs. Attack shows an upward trend with both winning and losing teams.
                This means that the two stats are correlated, but because this correlation exists regardless of the success of the team it is likely a pattern present in Pokemon designs rather than team designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph of HP vs. Defense shows more interesting results.
                Regardless of the defense of the team choosing a high or low HP value results in more success, as shown by the blue line deviating from the red line at the edges of the graph.
                Specifically, having low HP and low defense indicates an offense-focused team;
                having low HP and high defense creates a general balance of bulkiness, leaving room for other stats to influence a team's success;
                and having high HP and high defense makes a bulk-focused team.
                This begins a pattern present in many of the graphs that shows that having a specialization for a team results in more success than having an "all-rounder" team with no focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph of Attack vs. Special Attack shows a generally downward trend in winning and losing teams.
                The inverse correlation here shows that there are practically no Pokemon available to construct a team that has both offensive stats high.
                Most importantly from this graph is the separation between the two lines at high attack and low special attack.
                This is another example of choosing a specialization being beneficial compared to having no focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph of Attack vs. Speed shows no trend, although with two interesting exceptions.
                At low attack and high speed, successful teams are more prevalent; these might be support-based teams that have less of a need for physical damage output.
                At moderate attack and low speed, successful teams are similarly more present; these might be "Trick Room" teams that actually benefit from low speed stats.
                These disconnects from the unsuccessful teams shows that these specializations are again beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graph of Special Attack vs. Speed shows a significant separation between the winning and losing teams.
                The important feature present throughout this graph is that low speed paired with any amount of special attack is successful, compared to the more general stat distributions seen in red.
                This is likely due to many slow, specially-focused Pokemon receiving more support options than similar Pokemon with physical focuses.

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                The most important part of the conclusion is that the initial question seems to be useless for analyzing the data.
                In reality, there is no single stat that makes a significant difference in the success of teams.
                Rather, a specialization or focus in any stat results in more success compared to a team with fully average stats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the data analysis of this project was slightly limited by the tools available in the classes that these projects were based around.
                I believe that there are more options available to me outside of the classes that would enable me to make clearer conclusions about the data.
                These options might range from simple scatter plots to training various models with different types of artificial intelligence to identify patterns automatically.
